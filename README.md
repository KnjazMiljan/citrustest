#Steps for launching this app
* Clone the project
* Create a virtual host
* In init_db.php and bootstrap.php enter corresponding credentials for database (database name, username and password)
* From the root of the project in your Terminal run composer install
* After that, from the same terminal run php init_db.php (this will create db tables and seed some dummy data)
* After that feel free to test my solution :)

######disclaimer: I was carried away by the thought of creating my own framework during my work on this task, so due to a lot of overthinking I have managed to mess it up really hard, but it works.
